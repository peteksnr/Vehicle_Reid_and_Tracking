## üìÅ Project Structure
```bash
organize.py             # Organizes the VeRi dataset into train/test/query
train_reid_model.py     # Train the vehicle re-identification model
evaluate_reid.py        # Evaluate the trained re-identification model
video_evaluation.py     # Process video for vehicle tracking and identification
osnet.py                # OSNet architecture implementation
deep_sort_tracker.py    # DeepSORT tracking implementation
model.pth               # Pre-trained model weights
VeRi/                   # Raw VeRi dataset
veri_data/              # Organized dataset for training/evaluation
```
## üöÄ Usage
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
```bash
python organize.py
```   
This will:   
	‚Ä¢	Create train/, test/, and query/ directories   
	‚Ä¢	Organize images according to vehicle IDs   
	‚Ä¢	Prepare the dataset for training and evaluation   
 
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model
```bash
python train_reid_model.py
```
Trains the OSNet-based re-identification model using the data in veri_data/train.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate the Model
```bash
python evaluate_reid.py
```
Evaluates the model‚Äôs performance on the veri_data/test set.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Process Video for Tracking
```bash
python video_evaluation.py
```
Runs vehicle tracking and identification on video files.

## üöÄ Usage
```bash
veri_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ query/
```   
Before running training or evaluation:   
	1.	Place your VeRi dataset in the data/ directory   
	2.	Run organize.py to structure it properly    
	3.	The script will populate veri_data/

## üß† Model Architecture
	‚Ä¢	OSNet backbone for re-identification
	‚Ä¢	Multi-task learning for:
	‚Ä¢	Vehicle ID classification
	‚Ä¢	Color classification
	‚Ä¢	Vehicle type classification
	‚Ä¢	Batch-hard triplet loss for discriminative embeddings
	‚Ä¢	Adaptive triplet loss for stability
	‚Ä¢	DeepSORT for multi-object tracking in videos

---
## üìå Notes
	‚Ä¢	GPU acceleration is used if available (falls back to CPU otherwise)
	‚Ä¢	Training progress and metrics are displayed in the terminal
	‚Ä¢	Model checkpoints are saved automatically
	‚Ä¢	Always run organize.py before training or evaluation
